# CI Lab Kubernetes Helm Charts

A CI Tool hosted on Kubernetes

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repository as follows:

```console
helm repo add cilab https://kittisak-kueb.github.io
```

You can then run `helm search repo cilab` to see the charts.
